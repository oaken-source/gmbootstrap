===========

 This poject aims at creating an environment on which a load of bash scripts
derived from the Linux From Scratch project[1] are capable of bootstrapping a
running GNU/Minix Operating System, powered by Vagrant[2].

 Minix[3] is a Microkernel, which we hope will work well with the GNU userland
to provide the open source community with an excellent alternative to Linux.

 The current build of GNU/Minix uses LFS version 7.10, and Minix version 3.3.0

Current Status:

 v0.1: ...
